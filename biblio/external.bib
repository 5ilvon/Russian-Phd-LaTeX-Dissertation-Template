	abstract = {This paper presents a 4-bit 36 {GS}/s analog-to-digital converter ({ADC}) employing eight time-interleaved ({TI}) flash sub-{ADCs} in 40 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ({CMOS}) process. A wideband front-end matching circuit based on a peaking inductor is designed to increase the analog input bandwidth to 18 {GHz}. A novel offset calibration that can achieve quick detection and accurate correction without affecting the speed of the comparator is proposed, guaranteeing the high-speed operation of the {ADC}. A clock distribution circuit based on {CMOS} and current mode logic ({CML}) is implemented in the proposed {ADC}, which not only maintains the speed and quality of the high-speed clock, but also reduces the overall power consumption. A timing mismatch calibration is integrated into the chip to achieve fast timing mismatch detection of the input signal which is bandlimited to the Nyquist frequency for the complete {ADC} system. The experimental results show that the differential nonlinearity ({DNL}) and integral nonlinearity ({INL}) are −0.28/+0.22 least significant bit ({LSB}) and −0.19/+0.16 {LSB}, respectively. The signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio ({SNDR}) is above 22.5 {dB} and the spurious free dynamic range ({SFDR}) is better than 35 {dB} at 1.2 {GHz}. An {SFDR} above 24.5 {dB} and an {SNDR} above 18.6 {dB} across the entire Nyquist frequency can be achieved. With a die size of 2.96 mm * 1.8 mm, the {ADC} consumes 780 {mW} from the 0.9/1.2/1.8 V power supply.},

	title = {Switched-Capacitor Techniques For High-Accuracy Filter And {ADC} Design},
	abstract = {Switched capacitor ({SC}) techniques are well proven to be excellent candidates for implementing critical analogue functions with high accuracy, surpassing other analogue techniques when embedded in mixed-signal {CMOS} {VLSI}. Conventional {SC} circuits are primarily limited in accuracy by a) capacitor matching and b) the accuracy with which a differential amplifier can squeeze charge from one capacitor to another between clock periods. In Switched-Capacitor Techniques for High-Accuracy Filter and {ADC} Design, alternative {SC} techniques are proposed which allow the achievement of higher intrinsic analogue functional accuracy than previously possible in such application areas as analogue filter and {ADC} design. The design philosophy is to create the required functionality without relying on digital calibration or correction means but instead to develop methods which have reduced dependence on both component matching (especially capacitor matching) and parasitic effects (especially parasitic capacitance). However, the proposed techniques are just as amenable to further digital accuracy enhancement via calibration and/or correction as traditional methods. Two popular application areas are explored in the course of this book for exploitation of the proposed techniques, viz. {SC} filters and algorithmic {ADCs} - both cyclic and pipelined. Furthermore, efficient system level design procedures are explored in each of these two areas. The validity of the concepts developed and analyzed in Switched-Capacitor Techniques for High-Accuracy Filter and {ADC} Design has been demonstrated in practice with the design of {CMOS} {SC} bandpass filters and algorithmic {ADC} stages. For example, a 10.7MHz radio {IF} selectivity filter integrated in standard {CMOS}, employing the proposed methods, achieves an accuracy greater than ceramic filters. Another example is an {ADC} with better than 12-bit intrinsic accuracy, albeit capacitors with only 9-bits matching accuracy were used in the realization. The {ADC} architecture is also very robust and proven in an embedded digital {VLSI} application in the very newest 65nm {CMOS}. The power consumptions and silicon areas of the solutions proposed here are lower than other known solutions from the literature.},

Offset, gain, and capacitor mismatches between interleaved channels are calibrated by postprocessing the {ADC} output. Besides, a novel trimming-based calibration algorithm is used to calibrate the timing mismatches between channels. The proposed calibration algorithm is more power-efficient compared with most of its counterparts. The {ADC} consists of 18 parallel channels, a reference channel with two dummy channels, and a channel for timing calibration. The timing calibration channel is clocked only when the reference channel samples. The dummy channels are utilized to equalize the input load over time as they sample one after another to fill the gap where the reference channel does not sample. There is no need for any other dummy channels for timing calibration channel since it has low kickback noise over input driver. Each parallel channel operates at 111 ms/s while the reference channel runs at 105 ms/s. The aggregate sampling speed of the converter is 2 {GS}/s, and 52-{dB} {SNDR} is accomplished near Nyquist frequencies.},

The supply boosting technique ({SBT}) and supply boosted ({SB}) circuits including level shifter, comparator, and supporting electronics are described. Supply boosting provides wide input common mode range and sub-1 Volt operation for the circuits designed in standard {CMOS} processes that have only high-Vt {MOSFETs}. A 10-bit supply boosted {SAR} {ADC} was designed and fabricated in a standard 0.5 μm, 5 V, 2P3M, {CMOS} process in which threshold voltages of {NMOS} and {PMOS} devices are +0.8 and -0.9 V, respectively.

Measured figure of merit ({FOM}) was 280 {fJ}/conversion-step. Proposed supply boosting technique improves input common mode range of both {SB} comparator and {SAR} {ADC}, allows sub-1 Volt operation when threshold voltages are in the order of the supply voltage, and achieves low energy operation. Thus, {SBT} is suitable for mixed-signal circuit designed for energy limited applications and systems in where supply voltage is in the order of threshold voltages of the process. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, {LLC}.},

The design of the 1MHz {SAR} {DAC}, which consists of analog circuit and digital circuit, was designed according to the positive design method and the specific standard. And the {ADC} circuit was designed according to the sub-module layout. By the time the project design was finished, its hardware which was made of discrete components by welding printed circuit board ({PCB}) was debugged.

This designed {SAR} {ADC} can be applied to sensor interface, data acquisition system, portable test instrument, low power control system and some aspects of communication. Its absolute average error is about 1\% in the laboratory tests which meet the expectations of high accuracy requirement.

A digital offset mismatch compensation technique accommodates this trade off, however accuracy is not sufficient and more effective technique should be developed.

	abstract = {Purpose: Successive approximation register ({SAR}) analogue to digital converter ({ADC}) is well-known with regard to low-power operations. To make it energy-efficient and time-efficient, scientists are working for the last two decades, and it still needs the attention of the researchers. In actual work, there is no mechanism and circuitry for the production of two simultaneous comparator outputs in {SAR} {ADC}. Design/methodology/approach: A small-sized, low-power and energy-efficient circuitry of a dual comparator and an amplifier is presented, which is the most important part of {SAR} {ADC}. The main idea is to design a multi-dimensional circuit which can deliver two quick parallel comparisons. The circuitry of the three devices is combined and miniaturized by introducing a lower number of {MOSFET}’s and small-sized capacitors in such a way that there is no need for any matching and calibration. Findings: The supply voltage of the proposed comparator is 0.7 V with the overall power consumption of 0.257mW. The input and clock frequencies are 5 and 50 {MHz}, respectively. There is no requirement for any offset calibration and mismatching concerns due to sharing and centralization of spider-latch circuitry. The total offset voltages are 0.13 0.31 {mV} with 0.3VDD to {VDD}. All the components are small-sized and miniaturized to make the circuit cost-effective and energy-efficient. The rise and response time of comparator is around 100 ns. {SNDR} improved from 56 to 65 {dB} where the input-referred noise of an amplifier is 98mVrms. Originality/value: The proposed design has no linear-complexity compared with the conventional comparator in both modes (working and standby); it is ultimately intended and designed for 11-bit {SAR} {ADC}. The circuit based on three rapid clock pulses for three different modes includes amplification and two parallel comparisons controlled and switched by a latch named as “spider-latch”.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the power-optimized third-order Cascaded Integrator Comb ({CIC}) Filter for the {DeltaSigma} (Δ-∑) Analog-to-Digital Converter ({ADC}). The {CIC} Filter refers to a type of decimation filter used in {ADC} to remove quantization error caused by the modulator. It also occupies less area, when compared to other decimation filter, due to the absence of multiplier. In Δ-∑ {ADC}, the power consumption is mainly driven by the decimation filter. Hence, careful optimization of the decimation filter is necessary to design an {ADC} with low power. In this paper, the True Single Phase Clocked ({TSPC}) D-Flip Flop, which is made up of split-output latches, was applied as the register, instead of conventional D-Flip Flops. The proposed design displayed a significant reduction in power consumption. The proposed architecture was realized by using the {CMOS} 0.13µm technology. At 256kHz of sampling rate, the {CIC} Filter only consumed 47.99{µW} power. The supply voltage used at 1.5V and 13-bit of resolution had been achieved by using 32 oversampling ratio. The layout for 1-bit third-order {CIC} Filter was also realized with the size of 105.580 × 29.930µm2 .

The circuit uses a 2× time-interleaved architecture integrating two track-and-hold amplifiers, each driving a 5-bit flash sub-{ADC} sampled at 64 {GHz} in antiphase. For testing purposes, the chip also incorporates a time-interleaved 128-{GS}/s thermometer-coded 5-bit current steering {DAC}. The performance of the {ADC}-{DAC} combo, including the {SFDR} and the effective number of bits of 4 bits up to 32-{GHz} input signals, was characterized on die and includes the impact of the {DAC}. The power consumption and layout footprint of the {ADC}, critical for operation at 128 {GS}/s, were minimized by employing novel 1-{mA} Cherry-Hooper comparators and quasi-current-mode logic {MOS}-{HBT} latches with active peaking, which reduced the footprint of each of the 64 {ADC}-lanes to 10 μ m × 70 μm. The total power consumption of the {ADC} is 1.25 W and the total die area of the {ADC}-{DAC} chip is 1.1 mm \$× \$ 1.9 mm.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a low offset voltage, low noise dynamic latched comparator using a self-calibrating technique. The new calibration technique does not require any amplifiers for the offset voltage cancellation and quiescent current. It achieves low offset voltage of 1.69 {mV} at 1 sigma in low power consumption, while 13.7 {mV} is measured without calibration. Furthermore the proposed comparator requires only one phase clock while conventionally two phase clocks were required leading to relaxed clock. Moreover, a low input noise of 0.6 {mV} at 1 sigma, three times lower than the conventional one, is obtained. Prototype comparators are realized in 90 nm 10M1P {CMOS} technology. Experimental and simulated results show that the comparator achieves 1.69 {mV} offset at 250 {MHz} operating, while dissipating 40 μW/{GHz} ( 20fJ/conv.) from a 1.0 V supply. © 2008 {IEEE}.},

Combiners are closely related to wideband transformers in design and construction. The operating bandwidth of combiners must be wide or wider than that of the amplifier modules to not to restrict the overall bandwidth of the combined amplifiers. Transmission line techniques are commonly used in the in-phase and 180° power combiners for lowest losses and widest bandwidths. A class of hybrid that is a variation of the two-port is the quadrature hybrid. The 90° hybrid combiner or quadrature coupler can be realized in several different forms. The line hybrid is one of the most common combiners used in the {VHF} and {UHF} frequency ranges. The hybrid ring, 3/2 λ hybrid or “rat race” as it is commonly called, is a directional coupler that can be used to sample {RF} power traveling in different directions, and is thus adaptable also for mixer, power splitter, and combiner applications. The easiest coupler to construct is the branch line type called 3 {dB} unit. In this coupler, the main transmission line is coupled to a branch line by two quarter-wave lines, each spaced a quarter wave apart. Another power combiner that uses quarter wave transmission lines is the Wilkinson hybrid. It can be designed for any number of ports and is, thus, commonly called an N-way coupler.},

	abstract = {Filter circuits are used in a wide variety of applications. In the field of telecommunication, band-pass filters are used in the audio frequency range (0 {kHz} to 20 {kHz}) for modems and speech processing. High-frequency band-pass filters (several hundred {MHz}) are used for channel selection in telephone central offices. Data acquisition systems usually require anti-aliasing low-pass filters as well as low-pass noise filters in their preceding signal conditioning stages. System power supplies often use band-rejection filters to suppress the 60-Hz line frequency and high frequency transients. Active filters are circuits that use an operational amplifier (op amp) as the active device in combination with some resistors and capacitors to provide an {LRC}-like filter performance at low frequencies. This chapter introduces the three main filter optimizations-Butterworth, Tschebyscheff, and Bessel. It also describes the most common active filter applications: low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band-rejection, and all-pass filters. It concludes with a discussion of all pass filter design. An all-pass filter has a constant gain across the entire frequency range and a phase response that changes linearly with frequency; due to these properties, all-pass filters are used in phase compensation and signal delay circuits. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

@article{lee_ic_2004,
	title = {{IC} Op-Amps Through the Ages},
	abstract = {1.0 Introduction The operational amplifier concept emerged from extensive development of electronic ana-log computers in the 1940s. Operational amplifiers get their name from their ability to per-form mathematical operations such as summation, integration and differentiation. With the addition of logarithmic amplifiers and feedback, one may perform multiplication and division as well. These abilities allow op-amp circuits to simulate differential equations, such as those describing the trajectory of an aircraft, for example. Countless analog com-puters were used throughout the second world war to produce " smarter " weapons capable of predicting where a target would be some time in the future, to determine the optimal fir-ing conditions to ensure with high probability that a shell would intercept it then. The abil-ity to " program " an analog computer rapidly by changing amplifier gains and connectivity made it an indispensable tool for both weaponry and academic research. Mechanical ana-log computers had preceded electronic ones, and changing gears and linkages made repro-gramming a cumbersome affair. The desire for compactness and universality led to the development of general-purpose high gain blocks intended for use within a feedback loop, the op-amp idea that is " obvi-ous " today. Perhaps the most famous op-amp of the vacuum tube era was the Philbrick K2-W, whose particularly elegant design served as the inspiration for transistorized coun-terparts throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Early efforts at integrated circuit op-amps attempted to replicate on a one-to-one basis the connectivity of earlier discrete designs. These pioneering efforts led to impractical results, for the reasons we've discussed numerous times: {IC} technology offers a different set of strengths and weaknesses, and these different rules (should) result in different design approaches. Early {IC} op-amps, practical or not, were first implemented in bipolar technol-ogies, and it is in those technologies that many now-familiar topologies debuted. The col-lection of op-amp schematics here traces that history in order to gain an appreciation for why {IC} op-amp topologies are what they are. Even though these are mainly bipolar exam-ples, a great many of these topologies are perfectly amenable to implementation in {CMOS} form as well, with appropriate modifications (e.g., for biasing, etc.). At the very least, these examples may serve as a valuable source of inspiration for new designs.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent {MM}- {GBSA} calculations. Using the best {RMSD} among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate ({RMSD} ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide {SP} settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta {FlexPepDock} method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {{MOS} Current-Mode Logic ({MCML}) is a low-noise alternative to {CMOS} logic for mixedsignal applications. If properly designed, {MCML} circuits can achieve significant power reduction compared to their {CMOS} counterparts at frequencies as low as 300MHz. {MCML} logic has, however, fallen out of favor because of its high design complexity and the lack of automated design and optimization tools. In this work, simple and accurate propagation-delay models for {MCML} circuits, that are suitable for mathematical programming, have been developed and verified. The models are based on a modified version of the differential-pair {MCML} universal gate. The modified universal-gate performance has been compared to the standard universal gate topology. Simulations have shown that the modified universal gate has better {DC} symmetry, lower switching noise and higher operation frequency. When compared to simulation results, the proposed delay model has an average error of about 3.7\% and a maximum error of 12\%. The proposed model has significantly reduced the complexity of the {MCML} universal-gate optimization problem. When compared to the most recent work, the proposed model has reduced the number of optimization variables from 7N+1 to {iV}-fl, where N is the number of logic gates in the optimization problem. The optimization problem constraints have also been reduced from 5N to only one constraint. The model has been successfully implemented to optimize a T bit ripple-carry adder and an 8-bit decoder. Numerical tests show that the proposed optimization program produces the global solution regardless of the initial guess.},

	abstract = {Wireline communication has increasingly high demand on data rate. Channel loss isproblematicfor high speed transmission. Conventionally, analog equalizers are used to alleviate the problem. But recently, people have proposed an {ADC}/{DSP} based equalization scheme which directly digitizes the incoming attenuated data and then makesuse of the flexibility of the {DSP} to conduct the equalization in the pure digital domain. In thisdissertation, we propose a new high-speed time-interleaved analog-to-digital converter ({ADC})design that achieves power efficiency better than the state-of-the-art. Anew {ADC} structure, namely partially-active ({PA}) flash {ADC},is proposed for the implementation of the sub-{ADCdesign}. Anew source-follower based bootstrap track-and-hold circuit isalsodeveloped to reduce the input kickback noise. Furthermore, we propose a simplified multi-phase clock generation scheme. The scheme is based on extracting an input master clock with a pass gate. Becausethe delay of the pass gate is very short, the resulting timing skews among the sub-{ADC} viichannels can bemuch reduced. The residualtiming skew is calibrated out throughsimpleduty cycle correction. To verify our proposed techniques, a10-{GS}/s 6-bit time-interleaved {ADC} prototype was designed. The measurement results show that the test chip consumes 83mW and has achieved figure-of-merit of 197fJ/conv-step. At the low input frequency, the {ADC} has {SNDR} of 34.0dB and {SFDR} of 51.0dB. The corresponding {ENOB} is 5.4. At 5GHz Nyquist frequency, the {ADC} has {SNDR} of 32.0dB and {SFDR} of 44.7dB. The active die area of the {ADC} is 0.2 mm2. An open-loop 10GHz 8-phase clock generator is also presented in this dissertation. The open-loop architecture, with built-in compensation technique for the delay time variation, is composed of delay units and phase interpolators. The delay unit is designed with level-shifted active inductor load for power efficient delay operation achieving an efficiency of 0.19mW/{GHz}/phase at 10GHz. The active inductor is also made scalable to operate at different frequency. The 8-phase clock generator generates output clocks withgood phase accuracy and occupies 1500μm2die area.},

To improve the sampling linearity and {RF} sampling performance, the {ADC} employs input distortion cancellation and a digital background calibration technique to compensate for the non-linear charge injection (kick-back) from the sampling capacitors on the input driver. In addition, an effective dithering technique is embedded in the calibration signal to break the dependence of the calibration's convergence on the input signal amplitude.

	abstract = {This paper presents a 28 nm {CMOS} 10 b {SHA}-less pipelined/{SAR} hybrid {ADC}, designed to enable a direct-sampling receiver system. To achieve low power at 5 {GS}/s, the {ADC} combines pipelined and {SAR} quantizers, powered at 1.8 V and 1 V, respectively. A 2.5 b 2-way time-interleaved 2.5 {GS}/s multiplying digital-to-analog converter ({MDAC}) is followed by an 8 b 8-way time-interleaved 625 {MHz} successive-approximation register ({SAR}). This architecture combines the benefits of both {ADC} topologies and allows significant power and complexity reduction. The high-speed 2.5 b {MDAC} front-end simplifies the complexity of time-interleaving ({TI}) and provides gain for attenuating the 8 b {SAR} non-idealities, when referred to the {ADC} input, relaxing its specifications and design. To further reduce power, the 2.5 b {MDAC} front-end is {SHA}-less, and an over-range calibration loop that allows operation at multi-{GHz} input is introduced. A calibration technique is also proposed to align the {MDAC} and {SAR} references, whose misalignment would otherwise produce integral non-linearity ({INL}) degradation. The {ADC} achieves -61.8 {dB} {THD}, 57.1 {dB} {SNR} for a 500 {MHz} input, while for a 2.35 {GHz} input it achieves -54.7 {dB} {THD}, 46.8 {dB} {SNR} (55.8 {dB} {SNR} excluding the integrated {PLL} contribution).

A two-stage master-slave hierarchical sampling network, which is immune to the time skew of multi-phase clocks, is introduced to avoid the time-skew calibration for design simplicity and hardware efficiency. To perform low distortion and fast sampling at acceptable power consumption, a linearity- and energy efficiency-improved track-and-hold (T\&H) buffer with current-feedback compensation scheme is proposed. Accompanied by its low-output-impedance feature, the buffer obtains adequate bandwidth which can cover the entire {ADC} Nyquist sampling range. Moreover, the split capacitor {DAC} combined with a novel nonbinary algorithm is adopted in single-channel {ADC}, enabling a shorter {DAC} settling time as well as less switching energy. Capacitor mismatch effect with related design trade-off is discussed and behavior models are built to evaluate the effect of capacitor mismatch on {ENOB}. An asynchronous self-triggered {SAR} logic is designed and optimized to minimize the delay on logic paths to match up the acceleration on {DAC} and comparator.

	abstract = {Analog-to-digital converter ({ADC}) is a very fundamental and key part to nearly all kinds of electronics. The applications cover a wide range requiring different resolution to different sampling rate, including {UWB} systems, radar detection, wide band radio receivers, optical communication links, {CCD} imaging, ultrasonic medical imaging, digital receivers, base stations, digital video (for example, {HDTV}), {xDSL}, cable modems, and fast Ethernet. Among them, lower resolution very high speed {ADC} is a critical part for building {UWB} system, disk drive read channels and optical communication. This thesis consists of two parts. The first part focuses on the design of a high speed low resolution flash {ADC} in 90nm technology. Capacitive interpolation technique was used in this flash {ADC} in order to reduce the hardware requirement and input capacitance. No sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit is needed since the distributed capacitors viii(including capacitors in the very front end and the interpolated capacitors) serve to sample and hold the signals. Offset cancellation and averaging techniques are also implemented to reduce the offsets and the non-linearity. The {ADC} design achieves a sampling speed of 2.3GSps with 4 bits resolution in 90nm {CMOS} technology. The second part describes a new comprehensive {ADC} design methodology for capacitive interpolated flash {ADCs}, aiming to provide a quantitative, yet handy design guideline for circuit designers to conduct practical {ADC} designs. This new {ADC} design methodology provides a quantitative and comprehensive mapping between {ADC} chip level performance specs and various design parameters at different levels, such as, interpolation factor, number of stages, pre-amplifier bandwidth, loading effects, transistor sizes, technology parameters and etc. It serves to allow {IC} designers to conduct quick and quantitative flash {ADC} designs for well-balanced overall chip performance in practices. A dynamic power consumption analysis technique for capacitive interpolated flash {ADCs} is also discussed.},

	abstract = {In high-speed data communication systems, some form of channel equalization is necessary toprovide error-free data transmission. Analog techniques, such as feed-forward equalizers ({FFEs})and decision feedback equalizers ({DFEs}) are often used, and analog {FFEs} and {DFEs} working atbit rates up to 40 Gb/s exist; however, since digital equalization is more robust and offers a higherlevel of flexibility, it is becoming the preferred choice over analog equalization. Therefore, high-speed analog-to-digital converters ({ADCs}) are becoming fundamental components of high-speedcommunication systems. The bottleneck in such systems is the design of the {ADC} with reasonablepower dissipation.This thesis focuses on the challenges of high-speed, low power, low bit-error-rate {ADC} design.An 8 {GS}/s, non-interleaved, 4 bit flash {ADC} is proposed and the high-speed design techniquesused in the development of this A/D converter are presented. A novel comparator circuit, whichdemonstrates higher bandwidth compared to existing architectures – without the use of bandwidthenhancing inductors – is proposed. Also, a novel metastability detection circuit, which resultsin power-efficient metastability error reduction, is introduced. A commonly used technique toreduce the metastability error probability in high-speed flash {ADCs}, is to pipeline latches at thecomparator outputs. This results in an increase in the power dissipation and area of the converter. By incorporating this detection circuit in the {ADC}, low {BER} can be achieved with minimal powerand area overhead.},

	abstract = {Emerging communication technologies of the near future are being enabled by thefrequencies at or near the millimeter-wave ({mmWave}) spectrum (30-300GHz), whichprovides faster data rates. For very high performance wired and wireless applicationsin {mmWave}, such as digital phased arrays, 100GbE and 400GbE Ethernet, and {RFSampling} oscilloscopes, several challenges still exist in meeting the diverse dynamic range,bandwidth and integration needs. This work investigates the ability of advanced {SiGeBiCMOS} technologies to address these challenges, especially in the Analog-to-{DigitalConverter} ({ADC}) block - which is the common denominator for the digital signal processingused in these applications. Over the past decades, {ADC} design has shifted away {fromBiCMOS} processes, due to the high integration and digital calibration capabilities ofscaled {CMOS} technologies. However, advanced {BiCMOS} processes, especially the 90nmSiGe {BiCMOS} process from {GlobalFoundries}, show promise for the design of multi-{GS}/{sADCs}, with the combined benefit of {highfTnpn} {HBTs} that have high intrinsic gain, andthe digital integration possible from the 90nm {CMOS} available in this process.The objective of this research is to push the performance limits for {ADCs} for {mmWaveapplications} using Silicon-Germanium ({SiGe}) Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors ({HBTs}).High performance receivers for these applications must have low cost, low power, smallform factor, high sampling rate, medium to high resolution and a wide input bandwidth.The scope of this work is to first determine the design bottlenecks in {ADCs} throughsystem level {VerilogA} and Simulink modeling, and then optimize and integrate circuitlevel designs of those bottlenecks to design front-ends for analog-to-digital blocks. Theresearch includes the design of high speed sampling Track and Hold Amplifiers, Analogto Digital Converters, and one section focusses on {BiCMOS} {mmWave} mixers.The first key contribution lies in the development and demonstration of highly linearsampling-front ends, which are the key bottlenecks in {GS}/s {ADC} design. For digitizing awide-band {IF}, the implementation of dual-rank samplers for a 40GS/s Time-Interleaved({TI}) {ADC} is discussed. A literature review of state-of-the-art {ADCs} reveals that {currentGS}/s {ADCs} are prevalently designed in {CMOS}, require heavy calibration, and su↵er from low device intrinsic gain. It is proposed that {ADCs} implemented in {BiCMOS} havethe potential to change these trends, through performance improvements that lower thecalibration requirements for {GS}/s {TI} {ADCs}, and leverage the high performance npn {HBTsavailable}. The review is used to identify the Pipelined {ADC} as a potential candidate forinvestigating this research. The aim is to develop techniques and methodologies necessaryto achieve these goal, and examine the benefits and limitations {BiCMOS} processes maypresent to linearity and bandwidth improvements in {TI} {ADCs}.A detailed analysis and illustration of the functioning and operation of a 1GS/{sRF} sampling Pipelined {ADC}, as published in [{ADB}+14], is performed, through systemmodeling in {VerilogA}. It is demonstrated that the {BiCMOS} designs of the three majorblocks of a pipelined {ADC} - the comparators for the Flash sub-{ADC}, the sampling network,and the {OTA} - are comparable in performance in speed and power to the {CMOS} designspublished in [{ADB}+14], and that the design of multi-{GS}/s high performance {pipelinedADCs} in {BiCMOS} has substantial potential. This sets the stage for further analysis ofthese blocks in di↵erent technologies. The dual-rank sampling stages for {TI} {ADCs} areinvestigated due to their front-end linearity and bandwidth limiting performance. Thefront-end sampling network for multi-{GS}/s {ADCs} is chosen as critical to their overallnoise and linearity performance, and through an analysis of prior state-of-the-art samplerdesigns, the designs, architectures, and performance trade-o↵s for their implementationsare compared and contrasted, particularly for Switched-Capacitor and Switched {EmitterFollower} designs in advanced {CMOS} and {BiCMOS} processes.Afirst-ranksamplerisdemonstrated,usingthedesign,fabricationandmeasurementofa 40GS/s first-rank Track-and-Hold Amplifier ({THA}) designed as a fully bipolar {SwitchedEmitter} Follower in a 90nm {BiCMOS} process. This research was published as part ofthe 2015 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference [{LAR}15], as a state-of-the-art {BiCMOS}40GS/s sampler. The {THA} is measured to be highly linear, with E↵ective Number {ofBits}{\textgreater}4.9. The {SFDR} and {THD} performance is better than similar circuits published {inSilicon}, and comparable to {InP} circuits, which consume twice the {DC} power. Next, amethodical comparison of high-speed {SC} samplers in advanced processes of 28nm {CMOSand} 90nm {BiCMOS} is performed, and it is demonstrated, through simulated results, thattheir performance is comparable - specifically, the {SFDR} of a 5GS/s 90nm {BiCMOSsampler} is within 3-8dB of that of a 28nm {CMOS} sampler. It is shown that the benefitsof a linearization process (using a replica capacitor) for a sampling bu↵er are much higher for a 90nm {BiCMOS} sampler than a 28nm sampler, while 28nm {CMOS} switches are fasterfor the sampling aspect [{LAR}18].The last part of this research performs an investigation of the linearization techniqueusing a replica capacitor for high speed sampling bu↵ers. This includes provision of asmall-signal and large-signal explanation for its functioning and linearization e↵ects, andthe presentation of a design methodology for designing samplers using this technique acrossthree di↵erent processes - a 90nm {BiCMOS} process, a 28nm {CMOS} process, and a 45nmPDSOI process. A new explanation for the linearization e↵ect by the replica capacitor ispresented, by delineating the {HD}3 from the follower device and the common-gate device.Finally, a methodology for the design of these bu↵ers across the three di↵erent processesis provided.A final contribution is from the demonstration of a state-of-the-art 140-160GHz dual-sideband mixer, as shown in {AppendixA},andpublishedinthe2016EuropeanMicrowaveConference [{LAR}16]. A comparison with prior art in {SiGe} receivers in similar frequencyranges demonstrates this work to have the widest 3dB {IF} and {RF} bandwidths, and acompact footprint of 0.33mm2. The measured 3dB {RF} bandwidth extends beyond 30GHz,while previous works have reported a maximum of 8GHz. The single sided 1dB and3dB {IF} bandwidths are measured to be 10 {GHz} and 16 {GHz} respectively. This workfurther supports the potential of advanced {SiGe} {BiCMOS} processes in integrated {mmWave} solutions.},

	abstract = {Progress in 40Gb/s optical dual- polarization ({DP}) {QPSK} systems inspired an idea of 100G transmission by optical frequency division multiplexing ({FDM}) of {QPSK}-modulated channels [1]. A practical solution suggests two 58Gb/s {DP} {QPSK} channels, spaced by 50GHz (Fig. 21.7.1). The challenge is in implementing a 6b {ADC} operating at sampling rate of 29Gs/s, as compared to 24Gs/s reported before [2]. The other challenge is reduction of {ADC} sampling jitter. In an interleaved architecture, jitter is limited by the timing mismatch between the clocks of T\&H circuits. While initial timing error is compensated during {ADC} calibration, its spread over the input frequency range and drift may still impact jitter performance. This paper presents, to our knowledge for the first time, a 6b {ADC} operating up to 40Gs/s with power dissipation {\textless} 1.5W. The 30\% margin for the sampling rate reduces interleaved timing errors and therefore sampling jitter below 0.25ps-rms. The {ADC} also includes on-chip test signal synthesizer that generates a gigahertz range sinusoidal signal to simplify production testing. ©2010 {IEEE}.},

	abstract = {Automotive radars, along with other sensors such as lidar, (which stands for »light detection and ranging»), ultrasound, and cameras, form the backbone of self-driving cars and advanced driver assistant systems ({ADASs}). These technological advancements are enabled by extremely complex systems with a long signal processing path from radars/sensors to the controller. Automotive radar systems are responsible for the detection of objects and obstacles, their position, and speed relative to the vehicle. The development of signal processing techniques along with progress in the millimeter-wave (mm-wave) semiconductor technology plays a key role in automotive radar systems. Various signal processing techniques have been developed to provide better resolution and estimation performance in all measurement dimensions: range, azimuth-elevation angles, and velocity of the targets surrounding the vehicles. This article summarizes various aspects of automotive radar signal processing techniques, including waveform design, possible radar architectures, estimation algorithms, implementation complexity-resolution trade off, and adaptive processing for complex environments, as well as unique problems associated with automotive radars such as pedestrian detection. We believe that this review article will combine the several contributions scattered in the literature to serve as a primary starting point to new researchers and to give a bird's-eye view to the existing research community.},

A new comparator relaxes the stringent speed-noise trade-off under the 0.2-V supply.

The term "{StrongARM}" commemorates the use of this circuit in Digital Equipment Corporation's {StrongARM} microprocessor [1], but the basic structure was originally introduced by Toshiba's Kobayashi et al. [2]. The {StrongARM} latch has become popular for three reasons: 1) it consumes zero static power, 2) it directly produces rail-to-rail outputs, and 3) its input-referred offset arises from primarily one differential pair. In this column, we study the circuit and its properties.},

A fully differential, open-loop approach has been chosen in order to meet the specifications with respect to track-to-hold step, droop rate, and hold-mode feedthrough. In order to obtain maximum high-frequency performance, p-n-p transistors have been omitted from the design. The T\&H circuit has been realized in a 3-{GHz} {fT} bipolar production process, with a minimum emitter size of 2 x 9 μm2. The die size is 0.25 mm2, consuming 40 {mW} from a single 5-V power supply. Ten-bit performance has been measured up to 120-Msample/s full-Nyquist sampling rate. At 200 Msample/s, 8-b performance has still been observed over the full-Nyquist band. © 1992 {IEEE}},

Presently, {SAR} {ADCs} dominate low-speed applications and time-interleaved {SARs} are becoming increasingly popular for high-speed {ADCs} [1,2]. However the {SAR} architecture faces two key problems in simultaneously achieving multi-{GS}/s sample rates and high resolution: (1) the fundamental trade-off of comparator noise and speed is limiting the speed of single-channel {SARs}, and (2) highly time-interleaved {ADCs} introduce complex lane-to-lane mismatches that are difficult to calibrate with high accuracy. Therefore, pipelined [3] and pipelined-{SAR} [4] remain the most common architectural choices for high-speed high-resolution {ADCs}. In this work, a pipelined {ADC} achieves 4GS/s sample rate, using a 4-step capacitor and amplifier-sharing front-end {MDAC} architecture with 4-way sampling to reduce noise, distortion and power, while overcoming common issues for {SHA}-less {ADCs}.},

The circuit constitutes of combined low-noise amplifier ({LNA}) and down-conversion mixer cells distributed along the artificial transmission lines ({TLs}), to achieve wideband conversion gain, noise figure ({NF}), and linearity. A 3 stage {UWB}-{DRF} was fabricated in a 0.13 μm {CMOS} process.

	abstract = {This article presents a reference ripple cancellation technique for high-speed successive approximation register analog-to-digital converters ({SAR} {ADCs}) to address the reference voltage settling issue. Unlike prior techniques that aim to minimize the reference ripple, this article proposes a new perspective: it provides an extra path for the full-sized reference ripple to couple to the comparator but with an opposite polarity, so that the effect of the reference ripple is canceled out, thus ensuring an accurate conversion result. To verify the proposed technique, a prototype 10-bit 120-{MS}/s {SAR} {ADC} is fabricated in a 40-nm {CMOS} process. The proposed ripple cancellation technique improves the signal-to-noise and distortion ratio ({SNDR}) by 8 {dB} and reduces the worst case integrated non-linearity ({INL})/differential non-linearity ({DNL}) by ten times. Overall, the {ADC} achieves an {SNDR} of 55 {dB} with only 3-{pF} reference decoupling capacitor.},

The proposed {DDC} consolidates the functions of {ADC} and {TDC} into a single circuitry and achieves acquisition of both high-precision time and voltage data from the input, realizing a 5 times smaller analog front-end ({AFE}) area than prior arts. Such innovations lead us to a 40-channel {AFE} integration of the {SoC} without silicon cost increase, which characterizes our {LiDAR} system with 2 times higher pixel resolution. To enhance the {ADC}'s signal-to-noise and distortion ratio ({SNDR}) without sacrificing the area efficiency, a calibration-free and variation-tolerant voltage-controlled oscillator ({VCO})-based {ADC} with a multiphase pulse density modulator ({MP}-{PDM})-based feedback is proposed.

To quantitatively measure the effect of the resolution improvement of our {LiDAR}, we evaluate the {LiDAR}'s detection accuracy of small targets 75 m away. Due to the 2 times higher vertical pixel resolution, our {LiDAR} can detect targets with 2 times smaller height. The 3-D point cloud of the {LiDAR} captured outdoor in the wild is presented.},

The proposed discriminator is designed using microstrip band-stop spiral filters to achieve a compact size structure with high reject values between pass and reject bands. As these passive filters are fabricated on available ordinary substrates, the proposed structure is ultralow cost. Rectangular and circular spiral resonators are used to reject the specific frequency bands in each channel. The designed filters for each channel divide the frequency bandwidth into several pass/reject bands to produce the desired binary code. The proposed structure works in S-band with the maximum frequency error of 16 {MHz}. The proposed discriminator was simulated by a momentum simulator of an advanced design system ({ADS}) and fabricated on a 20-mil Rogers {RO}4003 substrate with tan(δ) and a conductor thickness about 0.002 and 18μm, respectively. An excellent agreement was achieved between the simulation results obtained by {ADS} and those of measurements; the average frequency shift is less than 10 {MHz}.},

By combining the instantaneous rotating angle with the anisotropic operator, an optimal time-frequency-varying window width is achieved to directionally compensate for the energy of each component. In addition, the chirplet ridge detection algorithm based on the anisotropic chirplet transform is further proposed to extract chirplet ridges in noisy signals.

	abstract = {We propose a time-domain delay estimator that takes the slope of the best fit line crossing the origin in the instantaneous frequency-phase difference plane as the delay estimate. This formulation differs from existing phase-based estimators in two respects. First, we find the instantaneous frequency at all individual sample points, including large and abrupt spikes caused by destructive interference in the coherent scattering process. This differs from Loupas which finds a smoothed-out center frequency estimate within an observation window. We show that under high signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}), the information from these spikes can be properly used. Second, we show that error ought to be considered as the deviation of the phase difference from the best fit line rather than deviation from the averaged phase difference. Without considering instantaneous frequency, phase-based estimators make the following two errors: samples with phase difference far away from the center frequency need not be errors as they naturally have large phase difference when their instantaneous frequency is large; samples with phase difference close to the center frequency may in fact be errors if their instantaneous frequency is large. We derive the Gauss-Markov least-squares best fit line and then propose an iterative variant that removes samples from the line-fitting process if its deviation from the best fit line is sufficiently large. The iterative version can reduce the effect of aliasing for larger delays and also further reduce the root-mean-square error ({RMSE}) of the estimate. Simulation studies using various bandwidth, {SNR}, and delay parameters indicate that iterative phase least squares ({PLS}) begins to outperform correlation phase Loupas at between {SNR} of 30 {dB} (for larger bandwidths and larger delays) and 60 {dB} (for smaller bandwidths and smaller delays). As {SNR} increases, iterative {PLS} can reach a 30- to 50-{dB} increase in performance over correlation phase Loupas with respect to {RMSE} in the most favorable conditions.},

	abstract = {This article presents a {CMOS}-based, ultra-broadband frequency-modulated continuous-wave ({FMCW}) radar using a terahertz ({THz}) frequency-comb architecture. The high-parallelism spectral sensing provided by this architecture significantly reduces the bandwidth requirement for the {THz} front-end circuitry and ensures that the peak output power and sensitivity are maintained across the entire band of operation. The speed and linearity of frequency chirping are also improved by the comb system. An antenna-sharing scheme based on a square-mixer-first architecture is used, which not only leads to compact size but also facilitates the stitching of the multichannel radar {IF} data. To avoid the usage of high-cost silicon lens in the on-chip broadband radiation, a multi-resonance substrate-integrated-waveguide ({SIW}) antenna structure is innovated, which provides 15\% fractional bandwidth for impedance matching. As a proof of concept, a five-tone radar prototype that seamlessly scans the entire 220-to-320-{GHz} band is demonstrated. In the measurement, the multi-channel-aggregated equivalent-isotropically radiated power ({EIRP}) is 0.6 {dBm} and is further boosted to 20 {dBm} with a {TPX} (polymethylpentene) lens. The measured minimum single-sideband noise figure ({SSB} {NF}) of the receiver, including the antenna loss and baseband amplifier, is 22.8 {dB}. Due to the comb architecture, the {EIRP} and {NF} values fluctuate by only 8.8 and 14.6 {dB}, respectively, across the 100-{GHz} bandwidth. The chip has a die size of 5 mm2 and consumes 840 {mW} of dc power.

	abstract = {This paper reviews a class of linear transconductance cells, having proven value in a variety of communications applications, characterized by the use of parallel- or series-connected sets of differential pairs of bipolar transistors whose inputs and outputs are connected in parallel. These cells invoke a well-developed concept, known as the "multi-tanh principle." The key idea is that the individually nonlinear (hyperbolic tangent, or tanh) transconductance functions may be separated along the input-voltage axis to achieve a much more linear overall function. The simplest of these is the called the "doublet"; the linearity criterion and noise behavior are discussed in detail. Some novel forms are presented. Higher order cells, including the "triplet," are then discussed, together with a novel method for achieving linear-in-{dB} gain control with an important modification for extending the dynamic range.},

	abstract = {Extracting the unknown frequency of a radar pulse has been one of the most challenging aspects of instantaneous frequency measurement ({IFM}) receivers. The conventional {IFM} receivers are limited in accurate frequency extraction by their design. In this article, a digital processing unit is added to the conventional {IFM} to extract the frequency with higher accuracy. A 2-4 {GHz} {IFM} has been designed combining the compact conventional {RF} section with the new digital processing unit using a novel efficient frequency extraction algorithm. The algorithm of minimum mean square error ({MMSE}) estimator is explored for use within the {IFM}, and it is proven that it can achieve much higher frequency accuracy. The novelty of this article includes both investigation and development of the algorithm to be a good fit for the frequency extraction in {IFM} receivers and also a digital implementation of the algorithm which meets the minimum requirements of an industrial {IFM}. The design has been implemented using microstrip filters on Rogers substrate and a Spartan-3E field-programmable gate array ({FPGA}) processor. The measurement results show promising achievements and verify the principle idea of digital processing for accurate frequency extraction in {IFM} receivers. The designed and fabricated receiver reaches 1.7 {MHz} rms frequency error in the frequency band of 2-4 {GHz}, which is at least 10× improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art works.},

This paper presents first an analysis of errors of the {DFT} coefficients caused by frequency variation. The relations between the stationary case errors and the non-stationary ones are carried out. The bias removal of the interpolation algorithms are studied for rectangular and Hanning windows. Finally, a new interpolation technique that allows very accurate measurements of the instantaneous frequency is proposed. Interpolations with longer time of measurement and with larger number of points decrease the systematic errors. The proposed algorithm presents: very fast recovery time (3/4 of a new period), robustness to the amplitude varying, and very high accuracy (the maximal relative error is under one thousandth at slower frequency changes).},

	title = {Fundamentals of Time and Frequency 17.4 Time and Frequency Transfer Fundamentals of Time and Frequency Transfer • Radio Time and Frequency Transfer Signals 17.1 Introduction},
	abstract = {Time and frequency standards supply three basic types of information: time-of-day, time interval , and frequency. Time-of-day information is provided in hours, minutes, and seconds, but often also includes the date (month, day, and year). A device that displays or records time-of-day information is called a clock. If a clock is used to label when an event happened, this label is sometimes called a time tag or time stamp. Date and time-of-day can also be used to ensure that events are synchronized , or happen at the same time. Time interval is the duration or elapsed time between two events. The standard unit of time interval is the second(s). However, many engineering applications require the measurement of shorter time intervals, such as milliseconds (1 ms = 10-3 s), microseconds (1 µ s = 10-6 s), nanoseconds (1 ns = 10-9 s), and picoseconds (1 ps = 10-12 s). Time is one of the seven base physical quantities, and the second is one of seven base units defined in the International System of Units ({SI}). The definitions of many other physical quantities rely upon the definition of the second. The second was once defined based on the earth's rotational rate or as a fraction of the tropical year. That changed in 1967 when the era of atomic time keeping formally began. The current definition of the {SI} second is: The duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom.},

The {InP} {HBT} active mixer is based on the Gilbert transconductance multiplier cell and integrates {RF}, local oscillator, and {IF} amplifiers. High-speed 70-{GHz} {fT} and 160-{GHz} /max {InP} {HBT} devices along with microwave matching accounts for its record performance. Operated as a down-con verier mixer, the monolithic microwave integrated circuit achieves an {RF} bandwidth ({BW}) from dc-20 {GHz} with 15.3-{dB} gain and benchmarks a factor of two improvement in {GBP} over state-of-the-art analog mixer {IC}'s [l]-[9]. Operated as an up-converter, direct-digital modulation of a 2.4-Gb/s 231 -1 pseudorandom bit sequence ({PRBS}) onto a 20-{GHz} carrier frequency resulted in a carrier rejection of a 28 {dB}, clock suppression of 45 {dBc}, and less than a 50-ps demodulated eye phase jitter. The analog multiplier was also operated as a variable gain amplifier, which obtained 20-{dB} gain with a {BW} from dc-18 {GHz}, an third-order intercept of 12 {dBm}, and over 25 {dB} of dynamic range. A single-ended peak-to-peak output voltage of 600 {mV} was obtained with a ±35-{mV} 15 Gb/s 25 - 1 {PRBS} input demonstrating feasibility for {OC}-192 fiber-telecommunication data rates.

Theoretical analysis and practical implementation of the clock circuit are also discussed allowing the design of a {CMOS}-based clock featuring 180-fs jitter, which preserves high {SNR} against input frequency: state-of-the-art 73.5 {dBFS} have been observed at 150 {MHz} input, popular intermediate frequency ({IF}) for single-heterodyne {BTS} receivers. Finally, the figures of merit encompassing power, effective resolution, and speed rank the, dynamic performance of the {ADC} core among the best in its class. © 2005 {IEEE}.},

	abstract = {This paper reports the design and characterization results of a broadband, compact 140-170 {GHz} Double Side-Band ({DSB}) receiver fabricated in a 90nm {SiGe} process. The design is based on a balanced Gilbert cell, with on-chip integrated {LO} and {RF} baluns and an {IF} Variable Gain Amplifier ({VGA}). The receiver exhibits up to 7dB conversion gain with an {RF} bandwidth extending beyond the frequency range of 140-170 {GHz}. The measured single sided 1dB and 3dB {IF} bandwidths are 10 {GHz} and 16 {GHz} respectively, making this circuit useful for block down-conversion of broadband communication signals or high resolution radar applications. A maximum output power of 0dBm is measured, with an output 1dB compression point of -4dBm. The conversion gain of the receiver can be varied by as much as 6dB through the integrated {VGA}, thus enabling equalization of the frequency response. The {DSB} mixer is simulated to have a noise figure of 10dB+/-0.5dB across the operation frequency band, which is comparable to noise performance that could be achieved from integrating a low noise amplifier ({LNA}) in the front-end. The chip consumes 40mA from a 3.4V supply and requires 3 {dBm} of {LO} power. It occupies a compact area of 0.6mmx0.15mm excluding pads, which favors further integration into receiver arrays.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a track-and-hold amplifier based on a switched emitter follower with demonstrated sampling rates from 6.4 {GS}/s to 32 {GS}/s and an analog bandwidth of up to 19 {GHz} in the hold-mode. Linearity measurements in the first Nyquist zone show 4.9 - 7.9 bits of accuracy for the highest sampling rate, more than 6 bits for up to 25.6 {GS}/s, more than 7 bits for up to 12.8 {GS}/s and a maximum of 8.9 bits at 6.4 {GS}/s, all calculated from the {SNDR} values. Most comparable circuits use only the {THD} value to calculate {ENOBs}, since achieving high {SNR} is difficult for low signal power circuits. The measurement results of the proposed track-and-hold amplifier were obtained at a high differential input voltage swing of 2.0 Vpp while they can reach even higher values at 1.0 Vpp. The 1-{dB} compression point is even higher, at 18.9 {dBm}. This makes the circuit suitable for high signal or noise power applications that demand high data rates and high linearity at the same time, including radio frequency instrumentation and receivers in radar and satellite communications. Designed as the front-end of a folding {ADC}, an additional benefit is the track-mode masking, recovering the common-mode level of the outputs during the input track-mode, which can be important when working with high input voltages. The third-order intercept point of 27.4 {dBm} at 25.6 {GS}/s and up to 34.7 {dBm} at 6.4 {GS}/s shows the unique combination of high signal power and high linearity in a sampling circuit above 10 {GHz}.

Their performance is often limited by the noise and distortion from the front-end samplers, the design of which can be challenging. Modern {ADC} design has moved heavily to scaled {CMOS} technologies due to its attractive digital and integration capabilities, but these processes face challenges of high fabrication costs, and diminishing analog performance that has to be bolstered by extensive digital calibration. On the other hand, {BiCMOS} processes have advanced and scaled sufficiently that they may be able to offer the best of the mixed signal world. This brief examines, both theoretically and through simulations, the design of samplers for high-speed, low-distortion in {CMOS} and {BiCMOS} for {GS}/s {ADCs}. Two fully differential samplers, with an equivalent sampling frequency of 5 {GS}/s and an input frequency range of up to 10 {GHz}, are designed in a 90-nm {BiCMOS} and a 28-nm {CMOS} process, respectively, and their distortion performance is analyzed, simulated, and compared.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a 12-{GS}/s 5-bit time-interleaved flash {ADC} realized in 65-nm {CMOS}. To improve the dynamic performance at high input frequencies, a statistics-based background calibration scheme for timing skew is employed. The timing skew is detected in the digital domain through a correlation-based algorithm and minimized by adjusting digitally controlled delay lines. In order to minimize power consumption, we employ near minimum size comparators, whose offset is reduced through foreground calibrated trim-{DAC} circuitry. With the timing calibration activated, the skew-related impairments are reduced by 12 {dB} at high input frequencies, resulting in an {SNDR} of 25.1 {dB} near Nyquist. The prototype {IC} consumes 81 {mW} from a 1.1 V supply, yielding a figure-of-merit of 0.35 {pJ}/conversion-step at low input frequencies, and 0.46 {pJ}/conversion-step for inputs near Nyquist. © 2006 {IEEE}.},

A wideband front-end matching circuit based on a peaking inductor is designed to increase the analog input bandwidth to 18 {GHz}. A novel offset calibration that can achieve quick detection and accurate correction without affecting the speed of the comparator is proposed, guaranteeing the high-speed operation of the {ADC}. A clock distribution circuit based on {CMOS} and current mode logic ({CML}) is implemented in the proposed {ADC}, which not only maintains the speed and quality of the high-speed clock, but also reduces the overall power consumption. A timing mismatch calibration is integrated into the chip to achieve fast timing mismatch detection of the input signal which is bandlimited to the Nyquist frequency for the complete {ADC} system. The experimental results show that the differential nonlinearity ({DNL}) and integral nonlinearity ({INL}) are −0.28/+0.22 least significant bit ({LSB}) and −0.19/+0.16 {LSB}, respectively. The signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio ({SNDR}) is above 22.5 {dB} and the spurious free dynamic range ({SFDR}) is better than 35 {dB} at 1.2 {GHz}. An {SFDR} above 24.5 {dB} and an {SNDR} above 18.6 {dB} across the entire Nyquist frequency can be achieved. With a die size of 2.96 mm * 1.8 mm, the {ADC} consumes 780 {mW} from the 0.9/1.2/1.8 V power supply.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The {ADC} is composed of an integrated high-speed track-and-hold ampliﬁer ({THA}) driving up to eight interleaved pipeline {ADCs} that employ open-loop inter-stage ampliﬁers. Up to 10 {GS}/s, the {THA} operates at the full sampling rate using a non-interleaved single sample network, thereby eliminating the interleaving sampling time and bandwidth mismatch. Above 10 {GS}/s, the {THA} is programmed to use two ping-ponged, or an optional (2 + 1) randomized, sample networks to spread the residual post-calibration interleaving spurs in the noise ﬂoor. The {THA} enables an input bandwidth of 18 {GHz} and employs dither injection and optional pseudorandom chopping. In the pipeline stages, dither-based background calibration detects and corrects gain, settling, memory, and kick-back errors. New dither-based background calibration algorithms are employed to detect and correct the arbitrary non-linearity in the form of integral non-linearity ({INL}) breaks and harmonic distortion up to the ﬁfth order in the {THA} and in the references, {DACs}, and inter-stage open-loop ampliﬁers of the pipeline {ADCs}. Moreover, new dither-based background calibration is implemented to detect and correct the chopping non-idealities, memory errors, interleaving mismatches, and order-dependent randomization errors. Compared to the fastest state-of-the-art with similar performance, this {ADC} achieves 80\% higher sample rate and 2.4× higher input bandwidth, and incorporates a {THA} that supports a 3.3× higher non-interleaved sample rate.},

	abstract = {A high-sensitivity, compact-size structure for instantaneous frequency measurement receiver is presented in this paper. The proposed structure utilizes seven small-size, high-performance, microstrip band-stop filters to shape the frequency bandwidth based on the binary division. The three-section Wilkinson power divider is designed to divide the input signal into several paths with good isolation between them. The output of each microstrip filter is divided into two paths, with and without amplification to increase the dynamic range, as much as the amplifier gain. The unknown frequency is reported by a 7-bit binary code which is generated by amplified path for low-power input signal and the other path for high input level. The proposed structure is fabricated on Rogers Ro4003 substrate with 8-mil thickness. Based on the measurement results, the proposed structure has-65-{dBm} sensitivity with about 70-{dB} dynamic range of frequency detection. Also, the measured root-mean-square error is less than 35 {MHz} at the power level of-30 {dBm}.},

	abstract = {Recent research has revealed the possibility to achieve non-magnetic non-reciprocity using time variance. However, prior {CMOS}-based circulators rely on the interference between non-reciprocal switched-capacitor/transmission-line gyrators and reciprocal transmission-line rings, which increases form factor and restricts frequency tunability and bandwidth ({BW}). On the other hand, our recent work on quasi-electrostatic wave propagation in switched-capacitor networks has proposed a new regime in multipath switched-capacitor network operation that enables an ultra-broadband, ultra-compact reciprocal/non-reciprocal true-time-delay element. In this work, we corroborate these findings by implementing prototype devices of the quasi-electrostatic delay element. Our measurements of the delay element reveal that delays of tens of nanoseconds over hundreds of {MHz} {BW} are realizable on-chip in a compact form factor. In addition, we apply synthetic rotation across these switched-capacitor networks to realize an ultra-broadband N-port circulator with ultra-compact form factor. We implemented a wideband three-port circulator showcasing this new architecture in a standard 65-nm {CMOS} process. The circulator exhibits symmetric performance across all three ports and dc-1-{GHz} operation for a modulation frequency of 500 {MHz}. The measured transmission losses of the circulator range between 3.1 and 4.3 {dB}, matching is-15 {dB}, isolation is {\textgreater}18 {dB}, and noise figure ({NF}) is consistent with the insertion loss. This device occupies an area of 0.19 mm2 (λ center2/1.9× 106), representing about 100-1000 × higher miniaturization compared to the prior art.},

   abstract = {This paper has presented the design of some phase correlators for two digital frequency discriminators (DFDs) of which operation is over the 2.0 to 6.0 GHz, or 6.0 to 18.0 GHz frequency range in electronic warfare system. The accuracy of frequency discrimination according to the isolation of correlator mixer are analyzed, and it is shown that LO-RF isolation has much effect on frequency discrimination error by deriving some analytic equations relating the LO-RF isolation and phase performance. We propose a novel method of phase sector compensation in order to improve frequency discriminating error. The phase error of the designed phase correlator is RMS 4.57° and the frequency accuracy is 0.95 MHz over the 2.0-6.0 GHz. Over the 6.0-18.0 GHz range, the phase error is 4.81°, RMS and discrimination accuracy is 1.49 MHz, RMS.},
